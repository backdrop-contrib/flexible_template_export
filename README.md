Flexible Template Export
=======


Export flexible template to code, creating a layout project with an `info` and
a `tpl.php` file.

Backdrop Installation and Usage
---------------------

1. Download the current, stable version from https://github.com/backdrop-contrib
2. Enable and navigate to /flexible_template_export.
3. Select a core flexible template to export from the dropdown.
4. Type in a human-readable name for the generated layout. The machine name
will be generated from this. A unique name is required to avoid conflict once
layout is copied.
4. Select if a header row and page components are desired.
5. Preview the resulting template code in the textarea and edit manually if
needed. The final content of the textarea will be used to generate the template.
6. Click export when ready. The layout template package will be saved to your
public files folder in a `template-exports` folder.
7. Move the create package to your layouts folder and use as normal layout.
